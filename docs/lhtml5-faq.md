# What is the difference between LHTML5 and ColdFusion?

## Well-Formatted
LHTML5 is a well-formatted markup scripting language; Coldfusion is not. In ColdFusion items like <cfelse> in <cfif><cfelse></cfif> are not open and closed meaning it is not well-formatted. 

## Customizable Tags
The LHTML5 design encourages the create of Module, such as navbar, rather than building a 10 layer deep statement of conditions. Unlikely ColdFusion, LHTML5 relies less on large nested objects that can be hard to read.

Coldfusion limits developers to a set of prebuilt tags. In LHTML5 any tag can be used. And pre-exist HTML5 tags can be enhanced or transformed. For example, with LHTML5 for accessibility compliance, the alt attribute could be set to decorator when missing from img elements.
