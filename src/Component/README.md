# Component

Components are modular. 

## Examples
The packaged Components are provided for demonstration purposes.
They are optionally included by Builder.

## Atomic Design
Although not required, developers are encouraged to think of atomic design
 when developing Components. Consider what Atomic Design stage the output would 
 fall into, either:
+ an atom (basic HTML elements), 
+ a molecules (simple elements functioning together), or
+ a organism (complex UI components).

(Components typically reside in templates, but are not standalone templates).

## WYSIWYG
Components can be integrated with a WYSIWYG, such as TinyMCE.
