# Modules
Modules are parts designed to be swapped in and out of the Builder using a Configuration. The packaged Modules are primarily provided for demonstration purposes. You're not locked into using any of them. Build your own Custom Modules and share back reusable ones back for consideration as a Core Module.

## Atomic Design
Developers are encouraged to think of atomic design when developing Custom modules. Consider what Atomic Design stage the output would fall into, either:
+ an atom (basic HTML elements), 
+ a molecules (simple elements functioning together), or
+ a organism (complex UI components).

Modules often reside within page templates, but are not mean to serve as standalone templates.

## WYSIWYG
Modules can be integrated with a WYSIWYG, such as TinyMCE.
