# Modules

Modules are parts designed to be swapped in and out of the Builder using a Configuration.

## Optional
The packaged Modules are primarily provided for demonstration purposes. You're not locked into using any of them. Build your own and share reusable ones back.

## Atomic Design
Developers are encouraged to think of atomic design when developing modules. Consider what Atomic Design stage the output would fall into, either:
+ an atom (basic HTML elements), 
+ a molecules (simple elements functioning together), or
+ a organism (complex UI components).

(Modules often reside within page templates, but are not mean to serve as standalone templates).

## WYSIWYG
Modules can be integrated with a WYSIWYG, such as TinyMCE.
